# ltga-gomea-parallel
This repository contains the parallel implementation of LTGA GOMEA

## Work in Progress

I decided to publish this algorithm that I developed during my MSc. Thesis at Delft University of Technology.

Right now, this repository only contains an initial dump of the code that I found in my archives. 

Please bear with me as I cleanup and polish the code and documentation to make it easier to understand and use.
