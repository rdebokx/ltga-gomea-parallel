# ltga-gomea-parallel
This repository contains the parallel implementation of LTGA GOMEA

## Work in Progress

I decided to publish this algorithm that I developed during my MSc. Thesis at Delft University of Technology.

Right now, this repository only contains an initial dump of the code that I found in my archives. 

Please bear with me as I cleanup and polish the code and documentation to make it easier to understand and use.

## Running the application

### Requirements

* Java 8+

### Using Gradle
To run LTGA GOMEA directly on your machine, use the following command:

```shell
./gradlew run
```

To list all the possible Gradle tasks, run `./gradlew tasks`

#### Configurations
TODO: define the configurations format of the different problems

### Using Docker

Running the LTGA GOMEA Parallel in Docker is not supported yet.

## Development

* To run all unit tests, use `./gradlew test`

## License

LTGA GOMEA Parallel is licensed under the [MIT](LICENSE) license.
